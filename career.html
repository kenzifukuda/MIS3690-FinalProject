                Sonos is a sound experience company, connecting millions of listeners 
                all around the world to the content they want, where and how they want it.
    
                At Sonos I worked within the core FP&A team, creating month-end revenue and expense reports
                to be reviewed by upper management and external shareholders. Key tools I was using to extract, transform, load,
                and analyze financial data were Anaplan, SQL, Excel, and Tableau.
    
                In addition to my daily tasks, I created my own project to investigate user data surrounding listening hours and product
                registrations, segmenting user data based on geography, purchasing habits, and product usage. The goal was to try and explain
                the 48% increase in user engagement. Through my analysis I was able to provide insight and recommendations for what products are performing best, 
                in which markets, based on listening hours.
