                    Sonos is a sound experience company, connecting millions of listeners 
                    all around the world to the content they want, where and how they want it.
        
                    At Sonos I worked within the core FP&A team, creating month-end revenue and expense reports
                    to be reviewed by upper management and external shareholders. Key tools I was using to extract, transform, load,
                    and analyze financial data were Anaplan, SQL, Excel, and Tableau.
        
                    In addition to my daily tasks, I created my own project to investigate user data surrounding listening hours and product
                    registrations, segmenting user data based on geography, purchasing habits, and product usage. The goal was to try and explain
                    the 48% increase in user engagement. Through my analysis I was able to provide insight and recommendations for what products are performing best, 
                    in which markets, based on listening hours.

                organization’s new incubator space that will house these up-and-coming entrepreneurs. We constructed comprehensive cost and revenue models to evaluate 
                feasibility and affordability of project and ensure profitability within first 5 years of operation, as well as running scenario analysis to provide multiple options for designs and business models to the client.
