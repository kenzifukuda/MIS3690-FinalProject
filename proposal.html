    <h1>Kenzi's Project Proposal</h1>

    <h2>What is your website about?</h2>
    <p>I want to create a personal website similar to one I created over the summer. It would serve as a personal blog, and a place to house some of my professional experiences and personal interests.</p>

    <h2>What is the objective of your website?</h2>
    <p>I will use this website as additional material for potential employers to learn more about me and my experiences. It is also a way for me to start blogging again. Which is something that I stopped doing after school started again.</p>

    <h2>Who is your target audience?</h2>
    <p>The professional experience aspect of my website would highlight some of the projects and work I have done over the last few years. It is targeted towards potential employers to use as further reference material when considering me for positions within their company.</p>
    <p>The personal blog and my other interests would be targeted towards myself, friends, and family. It would be used as a way to update people on my life, and discuss topics that I find interesting and worth researching further.</p>

    <h2>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h2>
    <p>The personal blog page will have posts I hope to update weekly. It would be used as an external diary for others to learn more about me and what I am up to on a weekly basis.</p>
    <p>I would also have a page just for my resume for employers to reference.</p>
    <p>Along with my resume, I would include a page that displays some of the projects listed on my resume, so employers could see and experience the projects I have worked on.</p>
    <p>I also want to include a page that focuses on new ideas I have for businesses or projects I may potentially want to start. I am currently trying to start a podcast, so that may be something I want to add as an additional page.</p>
    <p>I would include an about me page as well, and a page to contact me,</p>
    <p>The landing page would have links to all the other pages, and include pictures and design that speaks to my personality and identity.</p>
