    <h1>My Financial Aid is Taxed and That's Not Okay</h1>

    <p>
        Biiiitch I'm poor. There is a REASON I'm getting financial aid. You wanna call that income? Financial aid is supposed to help those who cannot fund higher education themselves. 
        How do you expect lower class Americans to reach higher levels on the socio-economic ladder when you consistently find new ways to pull us backdown? 
        The few thousand dollars in tax revenue you receive from the small number of college students who get taxable scholarships and financial aid does not add up to nearly as much
        as the millions of dollars you would get from the corporations and billionaires if you raised their taxes by even .1% (I need to do the math on this, but I would imagine I'm correct).
        Check yourself government, and until then, I will NOT be filing my taxes. Come arrest me. I dare you.
