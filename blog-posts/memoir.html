    <h1>Everyone Should Write a Memoir</h1>

    <p>
        Memoirs and autobiographies are the pinnacle of narcissism, usually reserved for the rich and famous.
        Everyone wants to know how Jeff Bezos became the richest man in the world, or learn about Michelle Obama's time in the White House.
        But I don't think there's much to learn from those kinds of writing. People like that have lived under incredibly unique circumstances, 
        and to try and replicate their lifestyle and mentality is almost impossible.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would argue it's more important for regular people to write about their lives. People like me, or whoever's reading this. It's important
        to hear from regular people. To know we're not alone in the world. To know that someone out there is going through the same hardship,
        winning, albeit not as much as the rich and famous. But it puts things in perspective. Hearing about Jeff Bezo's achievements make anything 
        I do seem insignificant. Normal people winning motivates me. Their achievements are more attainable. If they can do it, why can't I?
        <br>
        <br>
        Memoirs don't have to be all about your success, though. They don't even have to be your whole life story, and they probably shouldn't be.
        I think the point of memoirs is to process and reflect, learning more about yourself and the people in your life, telling seemingly mundane
        stories through your own perspective. I love reading memoirs because they show an individual perspective. Everyone sees life a little differently,
        and often can articulate feelings and thoughts that I have in ways I have never been able to.
        <br>
        <br>
        This semester I am taking a class called Writing Creative Non-Fiction. Although it's not a business class like most classes are at Babson, I think
        it's just as valuable. Self-awareness is something I heavily value and emphasize in my own life and in others. Understanding yourself and your interactions
        with others is incredibly valuable in personal relationships as well as professional ones. Being honest with yourself and conveying your truth to others builds
        strong relationships. People trust and respect authenticity, and nothing should be more authentic than your own memoir.
        <br>
        <br>
        Writing memoirs this semester has allowed me to explore my relationships with myself and my friends, my experiences around the world, and some of those inner thoughts
        that keep me up at night. I never paint myself as the "hero" of the story, and I never put my friends on a pedestal. It's important to provide full context for the 
        "characters" in your memoir. If they're perfect, they don't seem real, and if you're perfect, it doesn't feel honest or vulnerable. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This notion of vulnerability is really scary for a lot of people --me included, which disincentivizes people to venture into writing about their own lives.
        Further, I think most people don't think their lives are interesting or special enough to write about. To that I say stop being so modest. And even if your life
        is truly that boring, it is the mundane that is the most interesting to describe and relate to. To frame an idea or event that is so common, but write through your
        own persepctive is unique. No one sees the world the same way you do. So write, even if it's just for yourself. You never know what you might come up with.
