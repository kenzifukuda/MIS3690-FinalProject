    <h1>Understanding K-Pop</h1>
    <div id="k-pop-blog">

            <i>K-POP The Genre</i>
            <br>
            K-Pop is an umbrella term used to categorize the musical exports of the entire country. 
            The term is a broad generalization given to any popular music from Korea, and ignores any distinctions of style or genre among artists and groups categorized this way. 
            While the term originated in Korea, it has become popularized among western culture because of its generalizing nature. The sense of “other” is emphasized in the use of the “K” in K-Pop. 
            For instance, immigrants who would come to the United States and be solely labeled by their ethnicity, and not necessarily by their occupation, education, likes, dislikes, etc. 
            Similarly, K-Pop’s migration into western media classifies the genre not by melody or instrument or singing or rapping, but simply by virtue of where it was created. 
            I’m not trying to say that this distinction is necessarily conscious or a bad thing. There is, however, a need to understand that the mindset of most people is not reflective of the current, highly globalized society. 
            In the United States, it would be fair to say that pop music would be defined as all mainstream, popular music. But the distinction here is that “mainstream” music is largely in reference to western,
            English-speaking countries and not inclusive of global pop music –if such a thing even exists. To keep in trend with the mislabeling of K-Pop, it would be more accurate to describe pop music in the United States as “US-Pop” or “E-Pop”. 
            I will continue to use the misnomer “K-Pop”, however, because I simply don’t know what else to call it.

            <i>Hangeul</i>
            <br>
            Hangeul:
            The Korean alphabet is a featural alphabet in that the letters have shapes based on the sounds they make. If you understand the system, you can read the letters relatively easily. 
            One of my many tried and forgotten hobbies was learning Korean, and while I don’t remember much, I never forgot how to read the alphabet. 
            The Hangeul letters for the consonants were inspired by the shape of the mouth and throat. I think it’s easier to understand if you try and do it yourself. 
            Below is a chart of the characters and their mouth shapes required to make the sounds for each if you’re curious:
        </p>
            <img id="hangeul-image" src="/images/hangeul.jpg" alt="hangeul" >
        <p>
            
    
            Syllable blocks in Hangeul are created in three parts: the onset, nucleus, and coda, signifying the beginning, core, and end of the sound respectively. 
            K-pop groups are formed similarly, separated into different parts. Their group structuring has less to do with chronology, however, and more to do with talent. 
            Boy bands in particular have a general grouping of singers, rappers, and sometimes performance units. I’m not really sure why this is unique to boy bands and doesn’t carry over to female groups, but it definitely has an effect on the structure of songs and performances. 
            While all members participate in each of these groupings to some degree, each member has their specialty. The core of K-Pop performances stem from the vocal unit’s execution of the chorus, while rapping and visual-based units focus on supplementing the main chorus with rap verses and displays of highly polished choreography. 
            I’m personally biased to the rappers in most groups as they are often the members that contribute to the production of the group’s music, and write their own lyrics. Rapping in Korean is particularly unique and my favorite part of the performance because of Hangeul, which can fit a lot more syllables per line than any rapper could in English, and provides easy rhyming structures to build lyrics around.  
            It’s an added layer of talent and creativity that I have come to appreciate more than the chorus or dancing.
            <br>
            Like the Hangeul characters, K-Pop idols must be rigid and precise with their choreography, training, and public image. The idols strive for 칼군무 (kalgunmu)  “dancing perfectly in sync”, practicing moves for up to 12 hours a day during training. The amount of mental discipline required to continue rehearsing and receiving criticism from instructors astounds me. 
            I could not imagine a situation in which I would not end up in tears and depressed on a daily basis. I would be curious to learn more about mental health among trainees, but it’s not something widely talked about in the industry. 
            I assume my findings would be discouraging to say the least. Trainees, as they’re referred to before becoming idols, must also continue their studies, learn Korean, Japanese, and etiquette, stick to strict dieting, and maintain the image of well-behaved, (unproblematic?) Korean boys and girls.
            There is often the image of the first generation Asian American child on their way to sports practice, going after school or on weekends to Japanese school for extra math and language lessons, or crying in front of the piano during lessons.
            I did not think it was possible to have a more time-consuming adolescence, but K-Pop trainee programs proved me wrong. It is not uncommon in Asian culture to emphasize this idea of perfection, but unlike a parent who provides that “tough-love” mentality to help their children succeed, record labels remove the love from this equation, pushing the trainees to their limits to simulate what they perceive to be “real-world working conditions” as an idol –more on this process later.
            The language itself is relatively easier to learn and understand than other Asian languages, which works to the industry’s benefit. Fans of K-Pop can begin to learn the language on their own without much studying. In my own experience, it only took me about 2 or 3 days to memorize all the vowels and consonants. Do I know what I’m reading or saying when I say the words out loud? No, but it’s more than I can say about Japanese or Mandarin. The choreography for K-Pop performances also follow the simplicity of the language. Dance moves must be flashy and performed in unison among members, but cannot be so complicated that fans are unable to also execute.

            <i>The K-Pop Process</i>
            <br>
            If I had one regret from my childhood, it was not moving to Korea at the age of 12 to go through the trainee process and become a K-Pop idol. Then I did the research into what it takes, and I decided New Jersey wasn’t so bad. 
        You can begin auditioning for trainee programs at the age of 9 . In preparation for these auditions, hopefuls must train on their own to improve their singing, acting, and dancing skills. Auditions are held frequently in Seoul by the three biggest record labels: YG, JYP, and SM Entertainment, but it often takes up to 30 tries before getting accepted into one of the companies’ training programs. If you’re lucky enough to enlist in a trainee program, the process of preparing for debut can take up to four years and often times even longer. Along the way many trainees quit the process after the constant and intense rehearsals focused on perfecting weaknesses and building performance stamina. On a fairly regular basis, trainees must perform in front of the 
        company president who frequently points out areas of improvement and personally selects candidates he deems worthy of debuting.
        The trainee program isn’t just about singing and dancing, but also involves Korean lessons for non-native trainees, and Japanese and English lessons to help the company expand into international markets. Mandatory dieting and exercise, regular weigh-ins, media training, sex education, and etiquette lessons are also common aspects of the program. Trainees are not paid and if they quit, they often incur thousands of dollars in debt to the label for all the training. While they are provided meals and housing, the living conditions are similar to those of military camps, but probably less sanitary.
        If you’re lucky enough to be chosen to become part of a K-Pop group and debut, it is still not a guarantee for success. The industry has become increasingly saturated, with new groups debuting every month, further adding to the pool of competitors among which your group must stand out. The average life-span of a K-Pop group is between 5 and 7 years, but many never even make it that far because of the oversaturation, required military service among Korean men, and the strict lifestyle idols must follow. Even the scent of scandal among a K-Pop group can mean the end of their career. Signing an artist contract with the label can mean finally getting paid for your talents, but artists are often not initially compensated fairly for their work, and can often include clauses that restrict idols from pursuing their own artistic interests, posting freely on social media, or even dating certain people. As one of my K-Pop stan friends explained, “K-Pop creates new personalities, not just talent.”
